# MAT-462-Project
Made by Nick

Code for analytic solution to steady state flow is under PART I

Code for numerical solution to steady state flow is under PART II

Code for numerical solution to transient flow is under PART III

-Note that MAT_462_Project_Part_III_MKX is dependent on the file IMPTRI.py for the comparison to the exact solution

Code for numerical solution to non-linear flow is under PART IV

-Note that the .py version DOES NOT WORK. It was an early build I made and felt like archiving before switching to MATLAB.
